# Chatbot-For-SOP

# Project Overview

The **"Chatbot for SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)"** project aims to automate and optimize the creation and management of SOPs. 
This chatbot enhances operational efficiency by providing dynamic, context-aware responses and generating accurate SOP documents. 

*Note: This project is part of a company initiative, and due to confidentiality policies, the implementation code is not shared publicly. However, the methodology, findings, and insights are available for review.*

Business Problem: A leading AI consulting firm face challenges navigating lengthy SOPs, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and poor compliance. A solution is needed to provide quick access and clear understanding of SOP content.

Business Objective: Maximize efficiency and consistency

Business Constraint: Minimize cost, Maximize scalability.

Business Success criteria: Reduction in document processing time by 30%.

Economic Success criteria: Reduction in operational cost by least 30%.

ML Success criteria: Achieve an accuracy of at least 90%.

**Objectives**
